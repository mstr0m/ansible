{% for colour in colours %}
 
  Colour number {{ loop.index }} is {{ colour.name }}.
  
  {% set colour_count = 0 %}
  
  {% for person in people if person.fav_colour == colour.name %}
    {% set colour_count = colour_count + 1 %}
  {% endfor %}
  
  Currently {{ colour_count }} people call {{ colour.name }} their favourite.
  And the following are examples of things that are {{ colour.name }}:
  {% for item in colour.things %}
    - {{ item }}
  {% endfor %}

{% endfor %}
